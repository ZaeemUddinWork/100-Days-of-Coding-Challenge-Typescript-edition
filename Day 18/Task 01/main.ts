Question 52: Make a Smartphone Object: Create a simple way to keep track of a smartphone's details. 
Include its brand, model, and other key features like how much storage it has, the size of its screen, and how long its battery lasts.

Explain & TIP: Just like a box can contain smaller boxes, objects can contain other objects. 
This helps organize related information neatly.
