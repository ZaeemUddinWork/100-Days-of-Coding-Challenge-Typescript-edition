Question 76:
Function Parameters and Return Values:
Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters,
adds them together, and returns the result.
Show how you can call this function and log the result.

Explain & TIP:
Functions can take inputs (parameters) and give back an output (return value).
 They're like personal assistants that do a specific task for you and report back with the results.
*/
//function that will take 2 numbers and than add and give it back
function addnumber(number1, number2) {
    return number1 + number2;
}
//printing that result
console.log(addnumber(5, 6));
