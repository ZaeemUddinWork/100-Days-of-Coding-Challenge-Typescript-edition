Question 79: 
Creating and Accessing Object Properties: 
Construct an object representing a car with properties for make, model, and year. 
Then, show how you can access the model property of the car.

Explain & TIP: 
Objects are collections of properties, 
kind of like a box for storing related information. 
You can create an object to group related data and access its properties using
 either dot notation or bracket notation.

//car object with car detail
let car = {
    car_name:'Corolla',
    modle:'Xli',
    make:'Toyota',
    manufacture_year:2023,

}

//printing only specific property of that object
console.log(car.make)

// Result will be "Toyota"
